# shop-ui

This app requires the api to be running on `http://localhost:3333`, if you wish to change the default endpoint, simply add a definition in a `.env` file, like this:

`/.env`
```
VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3333
```

To run the API, download [this repo](https://github.com/douglaswcamargo/shop-api) and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.
